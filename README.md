Got it! Here's the **updated guide** to run a **React + TypeScript + Vite** project **by cloning it from a repository** instead of creating a new one.

## ✅ How to Run a React + TypeScript + Vite Project Locally (Cloning Method)

---

### ✅ 1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

> Replace `your-username/your-repo-name` with the actual GitHub repo URL.

---

### ✅ 2. **Install Dependencies**

Using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

Or using yarn:

```bash
yarn
```

---

### ✅ 3. **Run the Dev Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You’ll see output like:

```
VITE v5.x.x  ready in 300ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

---

### ✅ 4. **Open in Browser**

Go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to see your app.

---

### ✅ 5. **Project Scripts**

```bash
npm run dev       # Start local dev server
npm run build     # Create production build
npm run preview   # Preview built site
```
